# startwithflutter, 6 Hours workshop

Flutter is a cross-platform, mobile development framework created by Google. With user-centric design in mind, Flutter allows developers to create beautiful native apps on iOS and Android from a single codebase.

Do you really want to create the most beautiful mobile application that works on both Android and iOS on the same code base while it's sustainable and maintainable in one single code base? Then this workshop is for you!

This is a hands-on workshop that we are going through the most fundamental features in flutter which in the end you can create your own app completely independent and release to Google Play and AppStore.

Each section comes with practices on a working app which we are building throughout the workshop.
